# This is the "profile name". Your dbt_project.yml will refer to this name.
# E.g., in dbt_project.yml: profile: 'row_level_security'
row_level_security:
  # 'outputs' defines one or more "targets" (environments) for this profile.
  outputs:
    # 'dev' is the name of a specific target environment (e.g., development).
    dev:
      type: bigquery # Specifies the adapter for Google BigQuery.
      dataset: bqd # The default BigQuery dataset dbt will write models to.
      job_execution_timeout_seconds: 300 # Max time (5 mins) a BigQuery job can run before dbt times it out.
      job_retries: 1 # How many times dbt will retry a failed BigQuery job.
      location: ${region} # The Google Cloud region where BigQuery jobs will run.
      method:
        oauth # Authentication method. 'oauth' typically means dbt will use:
        # 1. Application Default Credentials (ADC) if running on GCP (e.g., GCE, GKE).
        # 2. Your 'gcloud auth application-default login' credentials if running locally.
      priority: interactive # BigQuery job priority. 'interactive' means jobs run as soon as possible.
      project: ${project_id} # Your Google Cloud Project ID.
      threads: 4 # Number of concurrent models dbt will try to build.
      maximum_bytes_billed:
        1000000000 # Cost control: 1GB. BigQuery will reject queries estimated
        # to process more than this amount of data.

  # 'target' specifies which of the 'outputs' configurations to use by default
  # if you don't specify one with `dbt run --target <target_name>`.
